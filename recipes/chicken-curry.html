    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken curry is common to several countries including India, countries in
      Asia and the Caribbean. My favorite of them though is this aromatic Indian
      Chicken Curry, I'm always just craving these flavors.

    <p>
      It brimming with flavor thanks to all the spices, it's rich and creamy and
      it's amazingly hearty when you finish it off with basmati rice or naan
      bread.
